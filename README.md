**Fall 2022 Medical Imaging Project**

This project allows you to enter various information for two objects in a scan and see a plot of the densities, T1 values, T2 values, and the final constructed image.

The various input information includes:

1. The left and right boundaries of the inside and outside objects
2. The T1 values of the inside and outside objects
3. The T2 values of the inside and outside objects
4. The density values of the inside and outside objects
5. The total scan size
6. The TR values of the inside and outside objects
7. The TE values of the inside and outside objects

All of the input data is checked for validity.

**To use this code, follow these simple steps:**

1. Input all of your data
2. Click the 'Check Inputs' button
3. Verify that all of the lamps have turned green
4. Click the 'Generate Images' button
5. Look at and/or save the output images
